# Robot
Mainly 8031 Assembler including monitor and virtual processor

Ok, so the Robot side probably isn't much use but there are a couple of potentially useful bits here:

## 8031 monitor
Allows you to inspect registers including special function registers, load intelhex files, jump to locations

## 8031 virtual machine
This is the same VM spec as the Pascal interpreter/compiler expects (See the Parser repo) so it's possible to program the robot in pascal.
